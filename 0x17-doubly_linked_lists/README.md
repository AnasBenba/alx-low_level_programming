# Doubly Linked List in C

A doubly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a data element and two pointers. These pointers, commonly called `prev` and `next`, point to the previous and next nodes in the list, respectively. This allows for efficient traversal in both forward and backward directions.
