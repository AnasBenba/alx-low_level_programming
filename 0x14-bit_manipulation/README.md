## Bit Manipulation in C

Bit manipulation is a technique used in computer programming to manipulate individual bits or groups of bits within a byte or word of memory. It is often used in low-level programming such as operating system development, device drivers, and embedded systems programming.

In C, bit manipulation can be done using bitwise operators. These operators work on individual bits in a binary representation of a number.
