* Variadic Functions

Variadic functions are functions that take a variable number of arguments. They are used when the number of arguments that a function needs to operate on can vary from one invocation to the next. Variadic functions are often used in libraries and frameworks to provide a flexible and extensible API.

In C, variadic functions are implemented using the facilities provided by the stdarg.h header file. This file defines a set of macros and types that allow you to access the variable arguments passed to a function.

* How Variadic Functions Work

Variadic functions take at least one fixed argument, which specifies the number of variable arguments that the function expects. This fixed argument is usually an integer called num_args or count. After the fixed argument, the function can accept any number of additional arguments, whose types and values are determined by the caller.

To access the variable arguments, the function must use the macros and types defined in stdarg.h. The va_list type is used to hold information about the variable argument list. The va_start macro initializes a va_list object to point to the first variable argument, and the va_arg macro is used to access each subsequent argument in turn. The va_end macro is used to clean up the va_list object when the function is done.
