*Structs and Typedef in C*

*Structs:*

Structs (short for structures) in C are user-defined data types that allow you to group together variables of different data types under a single name. The variables inside a struct are called members, and they can be accessed using the dot notation (.).

*Typedef*

Typedef is a keyword in C that allows you to create aliases for data types. This can make your code more readable and easier to understand.
