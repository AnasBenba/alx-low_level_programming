##Singly Linked List README

#Overview

A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element, called a node, contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list. The last node in the list points to null, indicating the end of the list.

Singly linked lists are useful for implementing many common algorithms and data structures, such as stacks, queues, and hash tables.

#Usage

To use a singly linked list in your program, you will typically create a class that represents the nodes of the list. Each node should have a value attribute and a next attribute that points to the next node in the list.
